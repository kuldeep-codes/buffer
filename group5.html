<h3 data-heading="**Explanation**" dir="auto"><strong>Explanation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Process1: Automatically check new transactions against validation rules every hour.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Correct Type: Action</strong></li>
<li dir="auto">This describes a batch job or a recurring process that executes business logic without direct user interaction. Action menu items are used to invoke runnable classes that perform these kinds of processing tasks. A user would use this menu item to set up and schedule the recurring job.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Process2: Manually review and correct transactions that have errors. No preprocessing is done.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Correct Type: Display</strong></li>
<li dir="auto">This requires a user to interact with data on a screen. Display menu items are used to open forms, which provide the user interface for viewing, editing, and correcting records.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Process3: Export transactions to another system when they successfully post.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Correct Type: Action</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">An "export to another system" is rarely just about creating a file. It is a full integration <em>process</em> that often includes:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Complex Logic:</strong> Transforming data in ways that are difficult or inefficient in a report's data provider.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Communication:</strong> Actively sending the data, for example, by calling a REST API or connecting to an SFTP server. An Output menu item cannot do this; it only generates a file for the user to download or saves it to an archive.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>State Management:</strong> After a transaction is successfully exported, you typically need to update its status in the database (e.g., mark it as "Exported"). This is a data-writing operation, which is the job of a process, not a report.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">you often "can't perform it by output report" because a real-world export is more than just a report. It's a runnable process. Therefore, you would create a class to handle all this logic, and you would use an <strong>Action</strong> menu item to trigger that class.</p>

<li dir="auto">Select the foreign key relation properties from EmplBankAccount.</li>
<li dir="auto">Set the value of the OnDelete property to Cascade.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Explanation" dir="auto">Explanation</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Select the foreign key relation properties from EmplBankAccount.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> In Dynamics 365, relationship properties are defined on the table that contains the foreign key. Since EmplBankAccount holds the reference to EmplTable (the "many" side of a one-to-many relationship), the relation is defined on the EmplBankAccount table. You must go to this table in the AOT to modify the relationship's behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Set the value of the OnDelete property to Cascade.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> The OnDelete property on a table relation dictates what happens to the related records in this table when a parent record is deleted. Setting it to Cascade instructs the system to automatically delete all child records (in EmplBankAccount) when the corresponding parent record (in EmplTable) is deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Why the other options are incorrect:" dir="auto">Why the other options are incorrect:</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Select the foreign key relation properties from EmplTable:</strong> This is incorrect because EmplTable is the parent table. The foreign key and the relationship definition reside on the child table, EmplBankAccount.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Set the value of the OnDelete property to Restricted:</strong> This setting does the opposite of what is required. Restricted prevents the deletion of a parent record (in EmplTable) if any child records exist (in EmplBankAccount). This is used to maintain data integrity by preventing orphaned records, but it does not automatically delete them.</li>

<li dir="auto"><strong>Clustered Index:</strong> This index determines the physical storage order of the data on disk. Since the table's rows can only be physically stored in one order, a table can only have one clustered index. By default in Dynamics 365, the primary index is also the clustered index unless specified otherwise.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Non-Clustered Index:</strong> This index is a separate structure from the data rows that contains pointers back to the actual data. It is used to improve the performance of queries by providing a fast lookup path for data based on the indexed columns. You can have multiple non-clustered indexes on a single table.</li>

<li dir="auto"><strong>Setting the Is Extensible property to true</strong> is the correct first step to allow extensions.</li>

<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm produces and sells jarred food goods. The organization has several production and warehouse locations across the United States. Each location runs both production and warehousing operations. The company has three locations: East, Central, and West.</p>
<p dir="auto">The company is upgrading its Dynamics AX 2009 system to Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Current environment." dir="auto">Current environment.</h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm plans to migrate customizations, data, and integration from its legacy system into Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Dynamics 365 finance and operations environment includes:<br>
• Multiple cloud-hosted development environments using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017<br>
• A Microsoft Azure DevOps project for source control<br>
• Two tier 2 environments for user acceptance testing and staging, as well as production</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm is currently in the planning and development phase of the upgrade process. The company's internal development team needs additional development resources to address issues. The company already created a project that is set up to use a custom model named GPExtensions.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Current environment - **Integrations**" dir="auto">Current environment - <strong>Integrations</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm has a new integration for its freight processing information. The internal development team created the secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site for the source information to be stored and the staging table to house the source information once the data is added to Dynamics 365 Finance. Information from the source will be transferred once a day from the source system and integrated with the target system. More than 10,000 records will be transferred over the integration. The company created an aggregate entity for the integration to minimize the amount of transmitted data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm has added a new integration for freight processing where all item weights, dimensions, and other factors will be configured in the external portal while planning the loads. Once the load is planned, it will be integrated into Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps for the freight invoice processing to occur.</p>
<p dir="auto">No duplicate invoices or posting are associated with the freight invoice charges. The integration of this information from the source system is intended only for report creation and compilation purposes.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Current environment - **Planned changes**" dir="auto">Current environment - <strong>Planned changes</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm wants to change inventory forms to fit its current needs. Any modifications or enhancements must follow the existing functionality for forms in Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Requirements - **Integrations**" dir="auto">Requirements - <strong>Integrations</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">All data from integrations have the same format as an existing Dynamics 365 Finance apps field. All enhancements or customizations must use existing assets before creating new functionality.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm wants to change its integration strategy to include real-time data from the freight processing source system. The inventory must update as it is sold from the system. That information will be updated in Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<p dir="auto">The freight processing integration requires the use of an SFTP site to store XML files from the source system. The additional integration will use OData and must be transferred in real time.</p>
<p dir="auto">A periodic batch job must:<br>
• Pull data from the SFTP site.<br>
• Import the data to a staging table used to hold the information from the source system.<br>
• Map source data to the target table in Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<p dir="auto">The imported Load ID field must be added to the Sales Order header for all processed orders. Additional requirements for integrations, including other integration strategies, may be necessary as the company grows. Existing tables must be changed to include the Load ID. The database will need to be synched before adding the Load ID field.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Requirements - **Changes**" dir="auto">Requirements - <strong>Changes</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm must change the Inventory Status form to include more columns. It plans to create a table to enter the data for the Inventory Status form as a new data source. The company wants to add both the Product Name field and Batch ID field to this new table. The current form includes the item number, location, license plate, product inventory dimensions, and quantity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The grid on the Inventory Status form must include the product name by using the item number and legal entity. The user interface must be created to include the new columns and the data must be available to add to the grid. The form must have only an Action Pane, a Navigation List, a List Style Grid, a Details Header, and a Details Tab in the design and include the Load ID field.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm is currently in the process of adding the other required fields: one for Product Name and one for Batch ID. The new fields must be related to extended data types for the original fields on the existing data source for the Inventory Status form. Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm plans to add the EcoResProductName and Batch ID data to the extended table for WHSTmpStatusChange. The fields on the table extension must be populated with data and visible on the Inventory Status form on insert.</p>

What are three possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.<br>
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Right-click the table and select Synchronize.</li>
<li dir="auto">Navigate to the Dynamics 365 menu and select Synchronize database.</li>
<li dir="auto">Right-click the solution and select Synchronize with database.</li>
<li dir="auto">Set the project property for Synchronize database on build to true and build the solution.</li>
<li dir="auto">Right-click the project and select Synchronize with database.<br>
B. Navigate to the Dynamics 365 menu and select Synchronize database.<br>
D. Set the project property for Synchronize database on build to true and build the solution.<br>
E. Right-click the project and select Synchronize with database.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The three correct ways to achieve this goal are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>B. Navigate to the Dynamics 365 menu and select Synchronize database.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This performs a full database synchronization. It compares every table definition in the application's metadata (AOT) with the current state of the SQL database and applies all pending changes. This is a comprehensive but potentially slow option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>D. Set the project property for Synchronize database on build to true and build the solution.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This automates the process. By enabling this property within your project's settings, Visual Studio will automatically trigger a database synchronization every time you build that project. This is a highly common practice for developers to ensure the database schema stays aligned with their code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>E. Right-click the project and select Synchronize with database.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> When you right-click on a D365 project in the Solution Explorer, the context menu contains an option to "Synchronize  with database". This performs a synchronization for <strong>only the items within that specific project</strong>, making it faster and more targeted than a full database sync.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Analysis of the Correction" dir="auto">Analysis of the Correction</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Why Answer A is Incorrect:</strong> There is <strong>no "Synchronize" option</strong> in the right-click context menu for a table element in the Visual Studio Application Explorer or Solution Explorer.</li>

<h3 data-heading="**Explanation**" dir="auto"><strong>Explanation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Track and delete only insert statements -&gt; LegacyRollback</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">The LegacyRollback mode is a specific implementation from older versions of the SysTest framework. Its mechanism is to keep a list of all records that are created (inserted) during the test's execution. At the end of the test, it iterates through this list and issues a delete command for each record. It explicitly does <strong>not</strong> track any update or delete operations, so those changes will be committed to the database. This perfectly matches the requirement to only track and delete inserts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Roll back transactions by using SQL save points -&gt; AutoRollback</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">AutoRollback is the modern and recommended transaction mode. It works by creating a SQL transaction savepoint before the test method runs. After the test completes, it simply issues a command to roll back to that savepoint. This single database operation efficiently undoes all changes made during the test (inserts, updates, and deletes) without needing to track them individually at the application level.</li>
