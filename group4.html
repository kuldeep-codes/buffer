<h3 data-heading="Explanation" dir="auto">Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>In Azure DevOps, queue a build from the corresponding branch and upload the package to the asset library.</strong> This is a common and recommended best practice for modern, automated development workflows. By using a build pipeline in Azure DevOps, you ensure a consistent and repeatable process. The pipeline takes the source code from the specified branch, compiles it, and generates the software deployable package as an artifact. This package is then uploaded to the Lifecycle Services (LCS) Asset Library, from where it can be deployed to the test environment.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>In Visual Studio, create a Dynamics 365 deployment package and upload the package to the asset library.</strong> This method is typically performed by a developer on their local development machine. Visual Studio provides the functionality to create a deployable package directly from the solution. The developer would right-click the project in the Solution Explorer, select "Create Deployable Package," and Visual Studio would compile the code and generate the package. This package would then be manually uploaded to the LCS Asset Library for subsequent deployment to the test environment. This approach is often used for smaller development efforts or when an automated build pipeline has not been configured.</p>

<h3 data-heading="Explanation" dir="auto">Explanation</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Create a runnable class and add the class to the CustomerDetailUpdate project</strong><br>
You must first create the file and the class structure within your project to have a place to write your code.<br>
<strong>2. Write code in the class to update the customer table</strong><br>
Once the class exists, you can write the specific logic required to perform the data update on the CustTable.<br>
<strong>3. Build the project</strong><br>
After writing the code, you need to build (compile) the project. This process checks your code for syntax errors and creates the necessary executable files. The project cannot be run without a successful build.<br>
<strong>4. Set the class as the startup object for the project and run the class</strong><br>
Finally, you designate your runnable class as the entry point (startup object) for the project. This tells Visual Studio what specific piece of code to execute when you run the project. You can then run it to perform the update.</p>

<p dir="auto">You are a Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations developer. You are testing a workflow in a user acceptance testing environment. You need to ensure that a specific user can accept purchase requisitions only if the requisition is in a specific status.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which two options can you configure to achieve the goal?</p>
<p dir="auto">Options:<br>
A.  Manual decision<br>
B.  Approval process<br>
C.  Conditional decision<br>
D.  Automated task<br>
E.  Manual task<br>
<strong>C. Conditional decision</strong> This workflow element is used to check if a specific condition is met. You would configure it to automatically verify if the Purchase requisition status == [Your Specific Status]. The workflow will then follow a "True" or "False" path based on the outcome of this check. This directly addresses the requirement that the action can only happen if the requisition is in a specific state.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>B. Approval process</strong> Following the "True" branch of the conditional decision, you would place an approval process. This element is designed to assign a review task to one or more users. You would configure this approval step and assign it to the specific user who needs to accept the requisition. This element provides the "Accept" and "Reject" outcomes required for an approval.</p>
<h3 data-heading="❌ Incorrect options:" dir="auto">❌ Incorrect options:</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A. Manual decision</strong><br>
This is used to allow a user to make a choice between branches in the workflow, not to enforce conditional approval logic based on requisition status.<br>
<strong>D. Automated task</strong><br>
This performs a task automatically - does not involve user approval or status checking logic tied to a specific user.<br>
<strong>E. Manual task</strong><br>
Assigns a task to a user to complete manually but does not inherently include conditional logic based on requisition status.</p>

<li dir="auto">Create a derived EDT for AccountBase and increase the field size.<br>
<strong>Create an extension for AccountBase and modify the Form Help property.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Explanation" dir="auto">Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Create an extension for AccountBase and modify the Form Help property:</strong> This is a valid operation. Properties such as Label, Help Text, and Form Help on an EDT can be modified by creating an extension. Since AccountBase is the root EDT, extending it to modify these user-interface-related properties is a standard and supported practice.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Create an extension for AccountId and decrease the field size:</strong> This operation is not possible for two key reasons. First, you cannot decrease the string size of an EDT through an extension; you can only increase it or keep it the same. Second, you cannot modify the string size on an extension of a <em>derived</em> EDT (AccountId). String size can only be modified on the extension of the root EDT in the inheritance chain (AccountBase).</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Create a derived EDT for AccountId and increase the field size:</strong> While you can create a new EDT derived from AccountId, this is not the correct way to increase the field size. The field size property is inherited from the ultimate base EDT (AccountBase). The standard and supported method for increasing the size is to create an extension for the root EDT (AccountBase), not to create a new derived type with a different size, which would break the integrity of the inheritance.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Create a derived EDT for AccountBase and increase the field size:</strong> Similar to the previous point, the correct method for increasing the string size of AccountBase and all its derived types is to create an <em>extension</em> of AccountBase and modify the StringSize property there. Creating a new derived EDT for this purpose is not the standard extensibility practice.</li>

<ul>
<li dir="auto">Yes</li>
<li dir="auto">No<br>
Yes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's the reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto"><strong>EDT Inheritance:</strong> In Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, EDTs can inherit properties from a parent EDT. In this case, BasicCalendarID inherits from CalendarID.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Property Propagation:</strong> When you change a property (like the string length) on a parent EDT, that change propagates down to all child EDTs that inherit from it, unless the child EDT has specifically overridden that property.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Applying the Extension:</strong> By creating an extension for the root EDT, CalendarID, and increasing its length, the new length will be inherited by the BasicCalendarID EDT. Consequently, the BasicCalendarID column in the WorkCalendar table will also have its length increased.</li>

<ol>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Add the OData v4 client code generator.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Reasoning:</strong> This is the first step you perform in your Visual Studio project. Before you can generate anything, you need to add the tool that does the generating. This is typically done by adding a NuGet package or an extension to Visual Studio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Point the MetadataDocumentUri variable to the Dynamics 365 Finance instance.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Once you have the code generator tool, you must configure it. The generator needs to know the "address" of the OData service so it can read its metadata (the contract that defines all available data entities, fields, and operations). You do this by editing the configuration of the generator (often a .tt file) and setting the MetadataDocumentUri variable to your D365 environment's URL, followed by /data/$metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Generate proxy classes.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Reasoning:</strong> With the tool installed and pointed at the correct service endpoint, you can now execute the main action: generating the code. This process reads the metadata and creates strongly-typed C# classes that represent the OData entities. These proxy classes make it easy and type-safe to write C# code that queries and manipulates data in Dynamics 365.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The action <strong>"Add the custom OData service endpoints in the ODataClient list"</strong> is not part of this initial setup sequence. That would be an action performed later <em>within your C# code</em> after the proxy has already been generated, likely to configure the client context at runtime.</p>

<h5 data-heading="Current environment." dir="auto">Current environment.</h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm plans to migrate customizations, data, and integration from its legacy system into Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Dynamics 365 finance and operations environment includes:<br>
• Multiple cloud-hosted development environments using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017<br>
• A Microsoft Azure DevOps project for source control<br>
• Two tier 2 environments for user acceptance testing and staging, as well as production</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm is currently in the planning and development phase of the upgrade process. The company's internal development team needs additional development resources to address issues. The company already created a project that is set up to use a custom model named GPExtensions.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Current environment - **Integrations**" dir="auto">Current environment - <strong>Integrations</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm has a new integration for its freight processing information. The internal development team created the secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site for the source information to be stored and the staging table to house the source information once the data is added to Dynamics 365 Finance. Information from the source will be transferred once a day from the source system and integrated with the target system. More than 10,000 records will be transferred over the integration. The company created an aggregate entity for the integration to minimize the amount of transmitted data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm has added a new integration for freight processing where all item weights, dimensions, and other factors will be configured in the external portal while planning the loads. Once the load is planned, it will be integrated into Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps for the freight invoice processing to occur.</p>
<p dir="auto">No duplicate invoices or posting are associated with the freight invoice charges. The integration of this information from the source system is intended only for report creation and compilation purposes.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Current environment - **Planned changes**" dir="auto">Current environment - <strong>Planned changes</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm wants to change inventory forms to fit its current needs. Any modifications or enhancements must follow the existing functionality for forms in Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Requirements - **Integrations**" dir="auto">Requirements - <strong>Integrations</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">All data from integrations have the same format as an existing Dynamics 365 Finance apps field. All enhancements or customizations must use existing assets before creating new functionality.</p>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm wants to change its integration strategy to include real-time data from the freight processing source system. The inventory must update as it is sold from the system. That information will be updated in Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<p dir="auto">The freight processing integration requires the use of an SFTP site to store XML files from the source system. The additional integration will use OData and must be transferred in real time.</p>
<p dir="auto">A periodic batch job must:<br>
• Pull data from the SFTP site.<br>
• Import the data to a staging table used to hold the information from the source system.<br>
• Map source data to the target table in Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<p dir="auto">The imported Load ID field must be added to the Sales Order header for all processed orders. Additional requirements for integrations, including other integration strategies, may be necessary as the company grows. Existing tables must be changed to include the Load ID. The database will need to be synched before adding the Load ID field.</p>
<h5 data-heading="Requirements - **Changes**" dir="auto">Requirements - <strong>Changes</strong></h5>
<p dir="auto">Munson's Pickles and Preserves Farm must change the Inventory Status form to include more columns. It plans to create a table to enter the data for the Inventory Status form as a new data source. The company wants to add both the Product Name field and Batch ID field to this new table. The current form includes the item number, location, license plate, product inventory dimensions, and quantity.</p>
<p dir="auto">The grid on the Inventory Status form must include the product name by using the item number and legal entity.

A company uses Dynamics 365 Finance. You are customizing elements for the extended data types (EDTs) shown in the following table.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">You have a table named WorkCalendar. The table has a column named BasicCalendarID that uses the BasicCalendarID EDT.<br>
You need to increase the length of the column by using an extension.<br>

<ul>
<li dir="auto">No</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto"><strong>The Goal:</strong> The goal is to change the length of the WorkCalendar.BasicCalendarID column.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>The Controlling Element:</strong> This column's properties are controlled by the BasicCalendarID EDT.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>The Inheritance Chain:</strong> The BasicCalendarID EDT derives from the CalendarID EDT.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>The Proposed Solution:</strong> The solution is to create a derived EDT from CalendarName.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>The Flaw:</strong> CalendarName is a completely separate and unrelated root EDT. Creating a new EDT that derives from CalendarName has no impact on the CalendarID -&gt; BasicCalendarID inheritance chain.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, the proposed action will not affect the length of the BasicCalendarID EDT and, consequently, will not change the length of the column in the table. The solution does not meet the goal.</p>

<p dir="auto">You are working with extended data types in Visual Studio.<br>
You need to create an extension of an Extended Data Types (EDT) that is derived from base data types.<br>
Which three properties can be modified? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.<br>

<li dir="auto"><strong>Label</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Explanation:" dir="auto">Explanation:</h3>
<p dir="auto">When you create an extension for an EDT, you are augmenting its metadata rather than changing its fundamental base type characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>String size:</strong> This is a common modification. For an EDT based on the string data type, you can increase its length in an extension to accommodate business needs.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Form help:</strong> This property allows you to change or add descriptive text that appears in the user interface, helping users understand the purpose of a field. This is a metadata property that is meant to be customized.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Label:</strong> You can change the default text label associated with the EDT. This is frequently done to align the terminology on forms and reports with a specific company's vocabulary.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The other properties cannot be modified in an extension:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>IsExtensible:</strong> This property is on the <em>original</em> EDT and determines whether it <em>can</em> be extended in the first place. You cannot change this property in the extension itself.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Alignment:</strong> This property is considered part of the base type's core behavior and is not modifiable through an extension.</li>

You have a custom enumeration named CarType. The enumeration has the following elements: Sedan, SUV.<br>
You must extend CarType and add a new element named MUV to CarType.<br>
You need to develop a solution that meets the requirements.<br>
Solution: Set the is Extensible property to true for the CarType enumeration. Create a new enumeration to add the MUV element.<br>
Does the solution meet the goal?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Yes</li>
<li dir="auto">No</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">No</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Explanation" dir="auto">Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Setting the Is Extensible property to true</strong> is the correct first step to allow extensions.</li>
<li dir="auto">However, <strong>creating a new enumeration</strong> does not extend the existing CarType enumeration. It would create a completely separate and unrelated enumeration. For example, if you created a new enum named ExtraCarTypes with the element MUV, it would be a different data type. You would not be able to use CarType::MUV in your code, as MUV would belong to the ExtraCarTypes enum, not the CarType enum.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to add a new value <em>to the existing CarType enumeration</em>. The correct approach is to create an <strong>enumeration extension</strong> for CarType, not a brand new enumeration. Therefore, this solution does not meet the goal.</p>

<p dir="auto">You are using EDTs whenever possible in coding for Finance and Operations. Which of these statements is not a benefit of using EDTs?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">A.  EDTs are more easily compiled</li>
<li dir="auto">B.  EDTs are reusable throughout the system</li>
<li dir="auto">C.  The code is easy to read</li>
<li dir="auto">D.  Properties can be inherited from parent EDTs<br>
A.  EDTs are more easily compiled</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">While EDTs are a fundamental best practice in F&amp;O development, the benefit does not lie in the compilation process itself. In fact, the compiler has to do&nbsp;more&nbsp;work to resolve the EDT's properties and its inheritance hierarchy compared to a simple primitive type like&nbsp;str&nbsp;or&nbsp;int.</p>
<p dir="auto">The real benefits of using EDTs are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>B. EDTs are reusable throughout the system:</strong>&nbsp;This is a primary benefit. You define an EDT once (e.g.,&nbsp;CustAccount) and use it for table fields, class variables, and method parameters everywhere a customer account is needed. This ensures consistency.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>C. The code is easy to read:</strong>&nbsp;Using EDTs makes code self-documenting.&nbsp;void myMethod(CustAccount _custAccount)&nbsp;is much clearer and less error-prone than&nbsp;void myMethod(str _accountNum).</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>D. Properties can be inherited from parent EDTs:</strong>&nbsp;This is a powerful feature for maintainability. If you create a&nbsp;CustName&nbsp;EDT that extends a base&nbsp;Name&nbsp;EDT,&nbsp;CustName&nbsp;will inherit properties like&nbsp;StringSize. If you need to change the length of all name fields, you can often do it in one place (the base EDT).</li>

<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>The process is run outside the client.</strong><br>
<strong>Global</strong><br>
<strong>Reasoning:</strong> Global::runAsync is a static method designed for server-side execution. It runs a process in the background via the batch framework and is not tied to a specific user interface or form session, making it ideal for processes initiated from batch jobs, services, or other non-client logic.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Display a message when the process is completed without a page refresh.</strong><br>
<strong>FormRun</strong><br>
<strong>Reasoning:</strong> FormRun.runAsync() is specifically designed to be called from a form. It maintains a connection to the form that initiated it, allowing it to display a message in the form's message bar upon completion without requiring a full page refresh. This provides a seamless user experience.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>The page must be refreshed for the message to be displayed.</strong><br>
<strong>Global</strong><br>
<strong>Reasoning:</strong> When you use Global::runAsync, the background process is completely decoupled from the client UI. After the process finishes (e.g., by updating a record), the form will not be aware of the change. The user must manually refresh the page (or the page's data source must be refreshed) to see the results of the completed process.</p>

<p dir="auto">Plan the architecture and solution design</p>
<p dir="auto">You are a Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations developer.</p>
<p dir="auto">You have a report in an existing model that connects with the following objects:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">in-memory table</li>
<li dir="auto">data provider class</li>
<li dir="auto">controller class</li>
<li dir="auto">contract class</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The report is locked for modifications.</p>
<p dir="auto">You need to create an extension of the in-memory table in a model and you add the new field to the extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.</p>
<p dir="auto">Actions:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto">Create a duplicate from the report in the model and add the new field on the report design</li>
<li dir="auto">Create an extension of the existing report controller class in the model. Update the class logic to point to the new report</li>
<li dir="auto">Create a duplicate from the existing data provider class in the model. Update the class to fill the value of the newly added field.</li>
<li dir="auto">Create a duplicate from the existing report controller class in the model. Update the class logic to point to the new report</li>
<li dir="auto">Create an extension of the existing data provider class in the model. Update the class to fill the value of the newly added field<br>
<strong>1. Create an extension of the existing data provider class in the model. Update the class to fill the value of the newly added field.</strong><br>
<strong>2. Create a duplicate from the report in the model and add the new field on the report design.</strong><br>
<strong>3. Create an extension of the existing report controller class in the model. Update the class logic to point to the new report.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 data-heading="Correct Sequence of Actions:" dir="auto">Correct Sequence of Actions:</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Create an extension of the existing data provider class in the model. Update the class to fill the value of the newly added field.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The first step is to inject the business logic that populates your new field. By creating an extension of the data provider class and using techniques like Chain of Command on its data processing methods (e.g., processReport), you can add the logic to calculate and insert the value into the new field of the in-memory table buffer after the standard logic has executed.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Create a duplicate from the report in the model and add the new field on the report design.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Since the original SSRS report design is locked, you cannot modify it directly. You must create a new report in your own model, effectively duplicating the design of the original. In this new report design, you can then refresh the dataset to include the new field from your table extension and drag it onto the report layout.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3. Create an extension of the existing report controller class in the model. Update the class logic to point to the new report.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The final step is to tell the Dynamics 365 framework to render your new report design instead of the original one. The controller class is responsible for initiating the report and specifying which report design to use. By creating an extension of the controller and subscribing to its main method (or using Chain of Command), you can intercept the execution and change the report name variable to point to your new, duplicated report design. This redirects the system to your modified report at runtime.</li>

<ul>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>MethodA: Private instance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Private:</strong> The method is described as being "called only from the class." The private access modifier restricts a method's visibility to the class in which it is declared.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Instance:</strong> The method "must access class variables." Class (or instance) variables hold the state of a specific object. Only instance methods can directly access the instance variables of the object they are called on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>MethodB: Public static</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Public:</strong> The method is "called from other places in the app," which requires the public access modifier to make it accessible from outside the class.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Static:</strong> The method "does not need to instantiate the class." Static methods belong to the class itself, not to a specific instance of the class. They can be called directly by using the class name (e.g., MyClass::MethodB()) without creating an object first. This also fits the requirement that it doesn't need to access class variables, as static methods cannot access instance-specific state.</li>

}</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">No</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="**Explanation**" dir="auto"><strong>Explanation</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">The provided solution uses <strong>inheritance</strong> (extends SalesLineType). This creates a new, separate class called mySalesLineType_Extension that is a <em>subclass</em> of SalesLineType.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach has two major problems in this context:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto"><strong>The new method is not added to the original class:</strong> The method ExtensionMethodDayofWeek() only exists on instances of the new mySalesLineType_Extension class. It does not exist on the original SalesLineType class that the rest of the application uses. Therefore, you cannot call salesLineTypeVariable.ExtensionMethodDayofWeek().</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Sealed Classes:</strong> Many standard Dynamics 365 classes, including SalesLineType, are marked as final (sealed). This means they <strong>cannot be inherited from</strong>. The code extends SalesLineType would cause a compilation error.</li>
</ol>
<h3 data-heading="**Correct Solution**" dir="auto"><strong>Correct Solution</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto">To correctly add a new method to a standard class, you must use a <strong>class extension</strong>. The correct code would look like this:</p>
<p dir="auto">xpp<br>
[ExtensionOf(classStr(SalesLineType))]<br>
final class mySalesLineType_Extension<br>
{<br>
public int myDayOfWeek() // Method name can be anything<br>
{<br>
return dayOfWk(systemDateGet());<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p dir="auto">This correct approach uses the [ExtensionOf] attribute to "bolt on" the new method to the original SalesLineType class. Now, anywhere in the code where you have a variable of type SalesLineType, you can call the new method directly: mySalesLineTypeVariable.myDayOfWeek().</p>

<h3 data-heading="✅ **1. Which type of class should you create to pass parameters to the report?**" dir="auto">✅ <strong>1. Which type of class should you create to pass parameters to the report?</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Data contract class</p>
<h4 data-heading="🔍 Explanation:" dir="auto">🔍 Explanation:</h4>
<p dir="auto">A <strong>data contract class</strong> is responsible for <strong>holding the parameters</strong> that users will input in the report dialog box. These parameters are then used to <strong>filter or customize</strong> the report output.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Report data provider class</p>
<h4 data-heading="🔍 Explanation:" dir="auto">🔍 Explanation:</h4>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>report data provider class</strong> (often called a DP class) contains the business logic to <strong>retrieve and process the data</strong> from the database, usually based on the values provided in the data contract class.</p>

<h4 data-heading="🔍 Explanation for 3 &amp; 4:" dir="auto">🔍 Explanation for 3 &amp; 4:</h4>
<p dir="auto">You use [DataMemberAttribute] on <strong>each parm method</strong> inside the data contract class to tell the system, “This is a parameter, and I want it to show up in the report dialog.”<br>

<p dir="auto">You are developing a model extension for Dynamics 365 Finance.</p>
<p dir="auto">You must create a model extension that extends objects from the Application suite package.</p>
<p dir="auto">You need to create and configure a new model for the extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.</p>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Assign a model to the VAR layer.</li>
<li dir="auto">Create a new model and add a reference to the Application Suite package.</li>
<li dir="auto">Create an extension class that references a class that exists in the Application Suite.</li>
<li dir="auto">Create a new model that is part of an existing Application Suite package.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Create a new model and add a reference to the Application Suite package.</li>
<li dir="auto">Assign a model to the VAR layer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-heading="Explanation" dir="auto">Explanation</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Create a new model and add a reference to the Application Suite package.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is the core principle of the extension model. To extend objects from an existing package like Application Suite, you must create your own, new model (which resides in its own new package). During the model creation wizard, you must then explicitly select the "Application Suite" package to create a reference. This reference tells the compiler that your model depends on Application Suite, allowing you to see and extend its objects.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Assign a model to the VAR layer.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Explanation:</strong> When you create a new model, you must assign it to a specific application object layer. The layers (like ISV, VAR, CUS, USR) are used to manage and separate customizations from different sources. The VAR (Value Added Reseller) layer is a valid and common choice for a partner developing an extension. This is a required configuration step in the model creation wizard.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why the other options are incorrect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Create an extension class that references a class that exists in the Application Suite:</strong> This is an action you perform <em>after</em> the model has been correctly created and configured. It is an example of using the model, not creating it.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>Create a new model that is part of an existing Application Suite package:</strong> This is not possible. The standard Microsoft packages, like Application Suite, are locked. You cannot add your own models to them. This describes the old, now deprecated, concept of overlayering, not creating an extension.</li>

<p><strong>The Documentation is Explicit:</strong> The page on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/extensibility/class-extensions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/extensibility/class-extensions" target="_blank">Class extensions</a> states the following under the "Rules for class extensions" section:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">"The extension class must be public."</li>
<li dir="auto">"The extension class must be final."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>The Question is Flawed:</strong> This immediately tells us the question is somewhat flawed because it presents two required actions as separate options (A and D). In a real-world scenario, you must do both.</p>
</li>
<li dir="auto">
<p><strong>Why "final" is the Better Answer:</strong> When an exam question presents two technically correct options, you must choose the one that is <em>most</em> specific or unique to the concept being tested.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="auto"><strong>public is a general requirement:</strong> Many classes in Dynamics 365 must be public to be accessible across different packages or models. It is a fundamental requirement for visibility, not something unique to extension classes.</li>
<li dir="auto"><strong>final is a defining characteristic of extensions:</strong> The requirement to mark an extension class as final is a specific design constraint of the extensibility framework itself. The reason is that extension classes are "stitched" into the base class by the compiler and runtime; they are not designed to be inherited themselves. This rule is unique to the nature of being an extension.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, because final is the attribute that enforces a core principle <em>of the extension pattern</em>, it is considered the more defining and specific action in this context.</p>
